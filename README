These are puppet manifests and rpm spec files for provisioning VMs running stun
servers.

Mozilla uses this to provide public STUN (RFC 5389) servers for use with WebRTC
ICE (RFC 5245) NAT traversal.

== AWS setup ==

To provision an instance with a single public IP (no vpc required):

1. yum install puppet
2. git clone <this repo>
3. puppet apply --modulepath=<repobase>/puppet/modules <repobase>/puppet/bootstrap.pp

This should leave you with a fully functioning stun server. Verify with:

4. stun-client <public-ip>

We will eventually build an AMI from the above.

Notes:
Logs are at /service/stun-server/log/main/current.

You probably want to bind an elastic IP to the instance.

Make sure the security group for that the instance has:
  - inbound rules for UDP and TCP port 3478 from any source
  - optionally rules for ICMP echo requests
  - optionally a rule for ssh if you need to log in

== RPM changes ==
The RPM we build is based off the EPEL version, with the NAT
patch from here:

No other changes are made (yet).
